
EmacsWiki Light Theme
=====================

This is an attempt to design a light theme for the [EmacsWiki](http://emacswiki.org), combining elements from various other [existing themes](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/CSS) (included in the originals subfolder) - suggestions and pull requests are welcome, or you can file an issue at https://github.com/bburns/emacswiki-light-theme/issues. At some point we could also open this up on the Devlist and Reddit for more feedback. 

Note that the current logo is just a placeholder - other designs or ideas are welcome! 

* Cali+  
 [x] use as a base  
 [x] have section separators but lighter dots (like it a bit more than underlined headers)  
 [x] headline text in normal font  
 [x] box around table of contents  
 [x] buttons at bottom  
 
* Made in California  
 [x] gray links  
 [x] larger `function references' text (had been too small on my system)  
 
* Planet CSS  
 [x] code block font  
 [x] colored syntax highlighting  
 
* Wikipedia  
 [x] large logo on left  
 [x] try headings with underlines instead of section separators  
 [x] try a vertical sidebar  
 
* Ideas  
 [x] test with 2nd level headers, h3  
 [x] try dotted underline for links  
 [x] try sanserif font - like serif a bit better  
 [x] try orange text for links - too garish  
 [x] make gotobar text smaller  
 [x] make logo and gotobar narrower to use less space  
 [x] make a menu bar along top for the search box and logo/sitetitle  
 
* Other  
 [ ] make new logo with 'emacswiki' in it  
 [ ] change menu items from "SiteMap" to "Site Map", etc  
 [ ] update the favicon  
 [ ] add links to emacs main page, manuals, twitter, rss  
 [ ] add a back to top link at bottom  
 
There is an image gallery with screenshots of some of the existing themes at http://imgur.com/a/czk9D. 

To test the theme you can either download the project and open one of the '''test*.htm''' files or visit  http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;bootstrap=0;id=CSSPreview;css=https://rawgit.com/bburns/emacswiki-light-theme/master/light.css - this uses a service provided by http://rawgit.com to serve github files with the appropriate content headers, though it will change to a more permanent location later. 

Note: some of the test* files may have extra whitespace here and there - this is just due to globally adding a linefeed after '>' characters to make the HTML more readable. 

To reset your theme go to
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;id=CSS;bootstrap=1, or see
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSS/ and choose one of the existing themes.
