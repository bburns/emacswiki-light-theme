
EmacsWiki Light Theme
=====================

This is an attempt to design a light theme for the [EmacsWiki](http://emacswiki.org), combining elements from various other [existing themes](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/CSS) (included in the originals subfolder) - suggestions and pull requests are welcome. :)

* Cali+  
 [x] use as a base  
 [ ] headings  
 [ ] have section separators but lighter dots  
 [ ] box around table of contents  
 [ ] buttons at bottom  
* Made in California  
 [ ] gray links  
 [ ] larger `function references' text  
* Planet CSS  
 [ ] code block font  
 [x] colored syntax highlighting  
* Wikipedia  
 [ ] large logo on left  
 [ ] maybe try a vertical sidebar  

There is an image gallery with screenshots of some of the existing themes at http://imgur.com/a/czk9D. 

To test the theme you can visit  http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;bootstrap=0;id=CSSPreview;css=https://rawgit.com/bburns/emacswiki-light-theme/master/light.css. This uses a service provided by http://rawgit.com to serve github files with the appropriate content headers, though it will change to a more permanent location later. 

To reset your theme go to http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSS/ and choose one of the existing themes.
