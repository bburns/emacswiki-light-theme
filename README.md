
EmacsWiki Light Theme
=====================

This is an attempt to design a light theme for the EmacsWiki (http://emacswiki.org), combining elements from various other existing EmacsWiki themes (included in the originals subfolder): 

* Made in California (gray links, but larger `function references' text)
* Cali+ (headings, have section separators but lighter dots, box around table of contents, buttons at bottom) 
* Planet CSS (code block font, colored syntax highlighting)
* Wikipedia (large logo on left, maybe try a vertical sidebar)

Suggestions/pull requests are welcome - this can be a collaborative effort.


To test the theme you can visit  http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;bootstrap=0;id=CSSPreview;css=https://rawgit.com/bburns/emacswiki-light-theme/master/light.css. This uses a service provided by http://rawgit.com to serve github files with the appropriate content headers, though it will change to a more permanent location later. 

To reset your theme go to http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSS/ and choose one of the existing themes.
