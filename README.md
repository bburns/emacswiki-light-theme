
EmacsWiki Light Theme
=====================

This is an attempt to make a light theme for the EmacsWiki (http://emacswiki.org), combining elements from various other existing EmacsWiki themes (included in the originals subfolder). 

For testing you can visit  http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;bootstrap=0;id=CSSPreview;css=https://rawgit.com/bburns/emacswiki-light-theme/master/light.css. This uses a service provided by http://rawgit.com to serve github files with the appropriate content headers. 

To reset your theme go to http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSS/ and choose one of the existing themes.
