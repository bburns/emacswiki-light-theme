
EmacsWiki Light Theme
=====================

This is an attempt to design a light theme for the
[EmacsWiki](http://emacswiki.org), combining elements from various other
[existing themes](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/CSS) (included in the originals
subfolder) - suggestions and pull requests are welcome, or you can file an issue
at https://github.com/bburns/emacswiki-light-theme/issues.

Note that the current logo is just a placeholder - other designs or ideas are
welcome!

To test the theme you can visit
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;bootstrap=0;id=CSSPreview;css=https://rawgit.com/bburns/emacswiki-light-theme/master/light.css -
this uses a service provided by http://rawgit.com to serve github files with the
appropriate content headers, though it will change to a more permanent location
later. 

You can also download the project and open one of the '''test*.htm''' files,
though note that some files may have extra whitespace here and there - this is
just due to globally adding a linefeed after '>' characters to make the HTML
more readable.

To reset your theme go to
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;id=CSS;bootstrap=1, or see
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSS/ and choose one of the existing themes.

There is an image gallery with screenshots of some of the existing themes at
